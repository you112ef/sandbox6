## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email Security Team

Send an email to: **security@vibecode.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### 4. Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and confirm the vulnerability
- We will work on a fix
- We will coordinate the release of the fix
- We will credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Features

### Code Execution Security
- **Sandboxed Environment**: All code execution happens in isolated Vercel Sandbox
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Timeout Protection**: Code execution has time limits
- **Network Isolation**: Limited network access for security

### API Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Authentication**: Secure API key handling
- **CORS Protection**: Proper CORS configuration

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of sensitive data
- **No Data Persistence**: No sensitive data is stored permanently
- **Encryption**: Data encryption in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Proper access controls and permissions

### Client-Side Security
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy headers
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers for all responses
- **Input Sanitization**: Client-side input validation

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep API Keys Secure**: Never share your API keys
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
5. **Code Review**: Review code before execution

### For Developers
1. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
2. **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
5. **Logging**: Secure logging without sensitive data
